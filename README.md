# Text_Data_Analysis
This is a Text Data Analysis Project Involving `(YouTube Case Study)`.

### Problem Statement  => Sentiment Analysis
When considering `Sentiment Analysis`, there are two keys involved which are `Polarity` and `Subjectivity`.
 
 -- `Polarity`:  Which ranges from  `[-1 to +1]` for negative and positive sentiments.
 
 -- `Subjectivity`: When there are no `Sentiments` in a sentence. 
 
 ### Packages:
 There are many Sentiment Packages such as `Vader`, `Pacy`. In this project i am using `TextBlob` which is a `NLP` library. 
 
 ### Error_Handling
 Use `try`,`except` to handle error in your code.
